# stocks-analysis

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

### Results: 

In 2017 all the stocks had a positive return except for TERP. DQ and SEDG were the best two stocks with a percentage of over 180%. 2018 took a different turn. The stocks had a negative return except for ENPH and RUN. Both ENPH and RUN had a 80% return in 2018. RUN improved by going from 5.5% to 84% from 2017 to 2018. Even though ENPH still had a postive return in 2018, return fell from 129.5% in 2017 to 81.9% in 2018. 

The run time for the original module script is about 0.75 seconds for both years. With the refractored code for both years the run time is about 0.2 seconds. Adding the ticker index allowed the computer to recall the list 
of tickers without having to read through the rows of data several times. 
	

### Summary: 

# 1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

An advantage to using refractoring code is saving time on typing the same statement over and over. With this risk comes with the challenge of paying attention to detail. Because of how easy it is to copy and paste, it's even harder to walk through the logic if you know it's already worked somewhere else. 
	
# 2.How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
 
 A pro for refratcoring for the challenge is the calculations and variables of the prices can stay the same. It was easier to read and understand since the logic was used during the module. The disadvantage is finding yourself in a situation of having to debug several errors and time is easily wasted on searching for an answer.
